### How it started 

It all started when I saw a reel on instagram while mindlessly scrolling of course. It was someone spreading awareness of HC and Blueprint, and when I saw what it had to offer, I was immediately invested. 

I had never done a proper electronics project before, just a few simple Arduino projects, but besides that, I had never designed a PCB, used CAD properly, or dealt with firmware before, therefore this project really taught me so much new things, especially in a field that I want to purse long-term. My goal is to study Electrical and Electronics Engineering in university, and this project gave me a small, but truly exciting glimpse into that world.

Eventhough the macropad itself is relatively simple, the process widened my perspective and showed me how much there is to learn.



### Difficulties:

I wouldn't say that any one part was significantly easier than the others, because they all required a lot of time and focus, however firmware was probably the biggest challenge. 

I genuinely spend two days just trying to compile everything, especially when there were errors flooding my terminal everytime I tried to compile! Even fusion tested my patience, especially when adjusting precise hole dimensions or reworking the case design after ideas came up.

That said, those challenges made the project memorable and exciting. I still remember that second when the firmware finally compiled, definitely one of the most satisfying parts of the whole process.
